                <h2>2. Data Protection & Security</h2>
                <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your account and data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Password Security:</strong> We never store your actual password. We use <strong>Bcrypt</strong>
                        (a robust hashing algorithm) with a salt factor of 10. Even if our database is compromised, your
                        password remains cryptographically secure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> We use secure, HTTP-only cookies with SameSite attributes to prevent
                        cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Content Sanitization:</strong> All AI-generated content is rigorously sanitized using DOMPurify
                        to prevent malicious code injection and ensure safe rendering.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Your story drafts and creative content are encrypted with <strong>AES-256-GCM</strong>
                        before database storage. Only our production servers hold the decryption keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Connections:</strong> All data transmission is protected using TLS 1.3 encryption.</li>
                </ul>
